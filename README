                       --------------------

Gestinanna::POF is a collection of modules providing an abstract 
persistant object framework intended for use by the Gestinanna 
application framework though it may be used outside of that framework.

Gestinanna::POF currently supports Alzabo, MLDBM, LDAP, and 
aggregations of objects.  Security is supported on an attribute basis 
instead of object basis, providing finer granularity than most other 
persistant object frameworks.  A rudimentary, abstract locking 
protocol is supported.  Transaction support is still in development.

Gestinanna::POF tries to stress security over performance, so it may 
not perform as well as other frameworks.  If you do not need attribute-
level security, you will probably want to look at one of the more 
mature frameworks available on CPAN.

To install Gestinanna::POF, download the distribution, untar, and cd 
into the resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

or

  % perl Build.PL
  % ./Build
  % ./Build test
  % ./Build install

Extensive tests of the Alzabo and aggregate support require the Alzabo 
package and DBD::SQLite.

Testing of the MLDBM support requires the MLDBM module.

Testing of the MLDBM::Sync support requires the MLDBM::Sync module.

Testing locking requires the NEXT module.

All modules required for testing and use are available on CPAN.
