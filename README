                       --------------------

Gestinanna::POF is a collection of modules providing an abstract 
persistant object framework intended for use by the Gestinanna 
application framework though it may be used outside of that framework.

Gestinanna::POF currently supports Alzabo, MLDBM, LDAP (limited 
testing), and aggregations of objects.  Security is supported on an 
attribute basis instead of object basis, providing finer granularity 
than most other persistant object frameworks.  A rudimentary, abstract 
locking protocol is supported.  Transaction support is still in 
development.

Gestinanna::POF tries to stress security over performance, so it may 
not perform as well as other frameworks such as SPOPS.  If you do not 
need attribute-level security, you will probably want to look at one 
of the other more mature frameworks also available on CPAN.

To install Gestinanna::POF, download the distribution, untar, and cd 
into the resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

or

  % perl Build.PL
  % ./Build
  % ./Build test
  % ./Build install

Extensive tests of the Alzabo and aggregate support require the Alzabo 
package and DBD::SQLite.

Testing of the MLDBM support requires the MLDBM module.

Testing locking requires the NEXT module.

All modules required for testing and use are available on CPAN.

The author lurks on both the mod_perl list as well as various IRC channels.
